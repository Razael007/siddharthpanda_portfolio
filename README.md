# React + Vite

Designed and developed a personal portfolio using modern web technologies, including React and Next.js, to showcase projects, experience, and skills. The portfolio features a clean, responsive layout with a focus on user experience, allowing visitors to seamlessly navigate through various sections. Integrated a downloadable resume feature and an interactive contact form to engage potential employers. The project reflects a strong command of front-end development while maintaining performance and accessibility standards.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
